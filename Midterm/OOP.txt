OOP.txt - This is the short answer/essay portion of the test.
In the file, I want you to complete the following in separate paragraphs.

a.  Describe the difference between object-oriented and procedural programming.

Object-oriented programming focuses on creating classes and then creating objects based on those classes. It is an attempt to mimick
real-world scenarios in the digital world. This type of programming often encapsulates data and methods into units
so that the variables of one class are separate from variables of another class.
Procedural programming, however, is far less abstact and requires step by step, concrete instructions to run programs.

b. Describe the difference between a class and an object.

A class is a blueprint for an object. It contains the instructions for its creation. An object is an instantiation of a class.

c.  Describe what inheritance means in object-oriented programming.

In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism by which a new class can be created from an existing class. The child class can inherit
methods and properties from the parent class. For example, a Spider Monkey class can inherit all the properties and methods that are passed down from a Monkey class,
since a Spider Monkey is a type of monkey.

d.  Describe what polymorphism means in object-oriented programming.

In object-oriented programming, polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. Creating both a default constructor and an overloaded
constructor is an example of polymorphism because they are both different forms of the same constructor.
